<h1>Notes:<h1/>

    -Using the B2BUA server the call will have 2 legs 
    -Caller and Server will have DIFFERENT Call-IDs than 
    Server and Callee
    -Because the Call-ID is ALWAYS generated by the UA, 
    In this case the Caller generates the first Call-ID. 
    The Server, acting as a UAC, generates the second 
    Call-ID (between B2BUA and Callee)
