<h1>Notes:<h1/>
- Using the B2BUA server the call will have 2 legs 
- Caller and Server will have DIFFERENT Call-IDs than Server and Callee
- Because the Call-ID is ALWAYS generated by the UA, In this case the Caller generates the first Call-ID and the Server, acting as a UAC generates the second Call-ID (between B2BUA and Callee)
